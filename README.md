# TradingToolkit_Yang-Zhang-Volatility
I have been trading with this oscillator for a couple of weeks. Clear signal to price gap helped me time the entries and exits better. Building upon from this excellent open source, I made a trading bot to execute my order with stop limit. I tuned the parameters myself with my own understanding of current crypto market.
